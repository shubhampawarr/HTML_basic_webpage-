            received the Best Research Paper Award, showcased my ability to effectively lead and coordinate tasks within
            a
            team.</p>
        <p>- Problem Solving: My technical knowledge gained from my engineering background, coupled with my strong
            reading
            skills, has cultivated my capacity for critical thinking and effective problem-solving.</p>
        <p>- Communication Skills: Proficient in conveying complex ideas through clear and articulate verbal and written
            communication, fostering effective collaboration and comprehension across diverse audiences and contexts. My
            continuous learning, extensive reading, and interactions with diverse individuals have significantly
